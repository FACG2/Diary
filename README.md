## Abstract idea:
Make an Application for allowing to write and save your diary.

### User Stories
> as a user

- I can create my account

- I can see all my diary that I wrote it when I login to my account


### Requirements

- [x] Login form with 2 fields - username and password
- [x]Client-side and server-side validation on login form, including error handling that provides feedback to users
- [x] Users only have to log in once (i.e. implement a cookie-based session on login)
- [x] Username is visible on each page of the site after logging in
- [x] Any user-submitted content should be labelled with the authors username
- [x] There should be protected routes and unprotected routes that depend on the user having a cookie or not (or what level of access they have).
- [x] Website content should be stored in a database
